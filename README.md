### Project Summary

Earlier MR studies (Voight et al. 2012; Zhao, Chen, et al. 2019) found evidence of heterogeneity for the
effect of HDL cholesterol on coronary artery disease (CAD). In this report, the research question we aim to
explore is:

Do lipoprotein subfractions have heterogeneous effects on CAD?

To answer this question, we will conduct a MR screening study that estimates the causal effect of each
subfraction on CAD. Some highlighting features of our analysis include:

• Genome-wide three-sample design

• State-of-the-art statistical method (Robust Adjusted Profile Score (RAPS))

• Multivariate MR
