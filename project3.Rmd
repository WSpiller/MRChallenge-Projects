### Project Summary

The aim of this analysis is to assess the causal effects of three blood lipid fractions (LDLcholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) on the risk of suffering from type 2 diabetes. In parallel to that, we illustrate the use of the JAM-MR algorithm, a recentlyproposed algorithm for pleiotropy-robust Mendelian randomization using summary data.
